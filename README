These functions implement the methods described in the SIAM Review paper on "power-law distributions in empirical data", written by Aaron Clauset, Cosma R. Shalizi and M.E.J. Newman in February 2009 (<http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062v2>).

They are translations to Python 2.6 of their original Matlab version (<http://www.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/>) made in August 2009 (and slightly corrected in the following months):
* The translation of randht.m is randht.py.
* The translations of plfit.m are plfit.py and plfit0.py (plfit0.py is a small adaptation of plfit.py).
* The translation of plpva.m is plpva.py.
* The translation of plplot.m is plplot.py.
* There is no translation of plvar.m.

These Python programs make use of Numpy, SciPy special Zeta function and Matplotlib Pyplot.
